# Task



(i) Data pre-processing: I checked for null values and I have added some new features like 

     Cleaning Techniques: I have applied 1.5 IQR technique for removing outliers in the modal column.

(ii) I have used the following features to create the model:
         
       Features = [Market Names, Varieties]
      I have created some new features from price date column like i.e. [ Year, month, Day].

(iii) Here we need to Predict the crop prices as it is one of the most important tasks to ensure 
         efficient crop planning and food safety in the country.
         
         As here, the price is Numerical hence I have used Linear Regression Algorithm for the price  

        Prediction of the crops.
  
(iv) I have used Linear Regression and Elastic Net CV Regularization algorithms for the price 
       prediction.
(v) Mean Absolute Error and R2 score are the loss functions I have used.
